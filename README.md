Lg gram 13 z990 hackintosh

Note I added a apple wifi card using one of my nvme ports



Whats working
basically everything:

- display
- keyboard backlight
- HDMI port
- USB C port
- Both of the USB 3.0 ports
- Sd card reader
- sleep
- sleep/wake when you close and open the laptop screen
- speakers
- headphone jack
- camera
- microphone
- trackpad
-

Whats not working

- touchscreen

- display brightness is not adjustable with the keyboard shortcuts but you can do it thru settings
it is possible to use the keyboard but I'm just to lazy to do it :)

-the battery indicator is a little glitchy and goes to 100% when you plug in the charger but the goes back to normal after about two minutes
